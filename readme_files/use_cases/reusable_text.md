### Reuseable Text

Be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Text that will be needed in more than one place in the documentation can be maintained in a separate file, then included wherever it's needed.

Use the markdown helper to include files, thus assembling the complete documentation.

Note that the included text may itself be markdown, which can be included verbatim, or it may be code or other example data, which can be included into a code block.
