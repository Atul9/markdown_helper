## File Inclusion

This helper supports file inclusion in GitHub markdown files, with code highlighting.

It lets you turn this:

```
[include_file](../include/xml.xml)

# Include XML

[include_file](../include/xml.xml)
```

into [this](test/expected/xml_included.md) (Tip: open in a new tab using ```Ctrl-click```, close using```Ctrl-w```.)
